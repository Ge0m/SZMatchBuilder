## Next Steps for Repository Owner

To complete the development branch setup, you need to:

### 1. Create the Development Branch

Run the setup script:
```bash
cd /path/to/SZMatchBuilder
chmod +x scripts/setup-dev-branch.sh
./scripts/setup-dev-branch.sh
```

OR create it manually:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b development
git push -u origin development
```

### 2. Configure Branch Protection Rules (Recommended)

1. Go to: **Repository Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules**

2. **For `main` branch:**
   - Click "Add rule"
   - Branch name pattern: `main`
   - Check: "Require a pull request before merging"
   - Check: "Require status checks to pass before merging"
   - Select the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow as required
   - Check: "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
   - Optionally check: "Include administrators" (recommended)
   - Click "Create"

3. **For `development` branch (Optional but recommended):**
   - Click "Add rule"
   - Branch name pattern: `development`
   - Check: "Require status checks to pass before merging"
   - Select the "Development Branch CI" workflow as required
   - Click "Create"

### 3. Set Default Branch (Optional)

To make new PRs target `development` by default:

1. Go to: **Repository Settings → General → Default branch**
2. Click the switch icon
3. Select `development`
4. Click "Update" and confirm

### 4. Test the Workflow

1. Create a test feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git checkout -b feature/test-workflow
   echo "Test" >> test.txt
   git add test.txt
   git commit -m "Test workflow"
   git push -u origin feature/test-workflow
   ```

2. Create a PR from `feature/test-workflow` to `development`
3. Verify the CI workflow runs
4. Merge the PR
5. Create another PR from `development` to `main`
6. Verify the deploy workflow runs after merge

## Benefits of This Setup

1. **Stability**: Production (`main`) is protected from untested code
2. **Testing**: All changes go through `development` first
3. **Automation**: CI/CD workflows ensure builds work before merge
4. **Documentation**: Clear guidelines for contributors
5. **Consistency**: PR template ensures all PRs have necessary information
6. **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages on `main` updates

## Workflow Summary

```
feature/xyz → development → main → GitHub Pages
     ↓             ↓          ↓
   Local        CI/CD     Deploy
   Testing      Build     to Prod
```
